Comments:
  My intent was a 'bin' build for a shelf case Anycubic Linear Plus I got back in 2017.  Left the original motors, frame, belts.
  Printed 'upgrades' swapped out the control board added a BTT pi and installed Klipper.  Changed endstops, altered a model (on printables)
  for a spare Pinda I had and I originally had a heatbed and magnetic plate but never brought them online.  Used a 12v supply I had and I
  think it came out pretty good.  As with all hobbyist printers its a work in progress.  As I had to write the config from scratch I started with
  the klipper sample and altered and added to fit my needs.

  Display customization suuuuuucks.  Conditional statements etc.  For example, I have a v0 display used in this but the delta calibration menus 'stock' don't work.
  It looks for a non printing state and 'delta_calibrate' in the printer config.  Well its there!  Still no show.. so I just made an entry to look for a non printing state.
  I'm finger banging the config for the display so its liable to change periodically.  Way too much going on and I dont want the extra baggage.
